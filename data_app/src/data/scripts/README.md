# Refreshing the analysis

This project hosts data visualisations in Flourish and also uses a data loader for the
homepage.

Data for both gets refreshed automatically during build.

The flourish data can be refreshed manually by running:
- ms_analysis.py
- eu_institutions.py

That data is also stored in the "data" folder of the app.
